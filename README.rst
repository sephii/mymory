What's that?
============

"The Memory Book" presents a nice way of remembering long numbers, that is by
translating each digit to a sound, then making words out of these sounds and
finally creating images with these words. It can sometimes be a bit difficult
to come up with words, especially in the beginning, and that's what this script
does.

Since the method is supposed to work with sounds and not letters the script
gives some wrong results but it's still quite reliable. Try it and see for
yourself!

Installation
============

You'll just need to have aspell installed and the corresponding dictionary of
the language you want to use. To use a language different than the default
(fr), edit the script and change the ``language = 'fr'`` line.

Then simply run the script ``./mymory.py``
